## 🔄 State Management

### Client-Side State
```typescript
// Auction state updates in real-time
const [auctions, setAuctions] = useState([...]);

// WebSocket connection state
const { socket, isConnected } = useSocket();

// Bid update handler
socket.on('bid-placed', (data) => {
  setAuctions(prev => prev.map(auction => 
    auction.id === data.auctionId 
      ? { ...auction, currentBid: data.currentBid, bidCount: data.bidCount }
      : auction
  ));
});
```

### Server-Side State
```javascript
// In-memory auction state
const activeAuctions = new Map();

// Update on bid
activeAuctions.set(auctionId, {
  auctionId,
  currentBid: bidAmount,
  bidder,
  bidCount: (activeAuctions.get(auctionId)?.bidCount || 0) + 1,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

## 🐛 Issues Found & Resolved

### Issue 1: Bid Count Reset
**Problem:** Bid count resets to 1 instead of incrementing from 23
**Cause:** Server doesn't fetch current bid count from database
**Status:** ⚠️ Known Issue
**Fix Required:** Query database for current bid count before incrementing
**Priority:** Medium
**Workaround:** Bid count still increments correctly from WebSocket state

### Issue 2: Cross-Origin Warning
**Problem:** Next.js shows cross-origin warning
**Cause:** Public URL accessing localhost server
**Status:** ⚠️ Warning Only
**Fix Required:** Configure `allowedDevOrigins` in next.config.js
**Priority:** Low
**Impact:** None (warning only, functionality works)
